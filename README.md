# Little Tale RPG

## Description

This is a JavaScript capstone project from Microverse curriculum. It is a real time RPG. It is built based on next features:
1. The player can control the main character on the map;
2. The main goal is to kill monsters using that character;
3. By killing monsters main character gains experience;
4. Based on experience main char level is increasing using next formula: `Math.round(((Math.sqrt(25 + 10 * experience) - 5) / 10))`;
5. Main char has states like: attack, hp, experience, attack radius which can change if the main char is increasing the level;
6. Monsters on the map are moving randomly and randomly time;
7. Each monster has its own states like: hp, attack, experience for killing, attack radius;
8. Monsters are powerful so player has to control the distance between himslef and  monsters;
9. Monsters attacks the player if he is not far;
10. The experience of the player is stored in an API;
11. There is a leaderboard where players can compete gaining experience from killing monsters;
12. The game can be finished in 3 ways: main char death, killing all monsters, restart etc.

P.S. Wanna mention that the battle system was fully implemented by me.
